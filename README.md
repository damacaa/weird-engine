# Weird Engine  

## Overview  

Weird Engine is a simple yet unique game engine featuring:  

- **Custom OpenGL Renderer**: Uses ray marching to render 2D Signed Distance Fields (SDFs).  
- **Physics Engine**: Implements Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) with custom SDF-based collision detection.  
- **ECS Architecture**: A fully custom-built Entity Component System (ECS).
